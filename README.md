# LIC-Forum-Project

In the area I currerently live, Long Island City, NY. There are many apartment building, usually residents in the same building are provided with a website that allows them to communicate, and sell used items or host activities like study groups and board game parties. But there is no such platform where people from different apartment buildings can communicate. This project is meant to build a space where people that are generally from this area can post listings, as well as activities.
